# SmartLight

## Overview
SmartLight is a light control system that grants wireless manipulation over 12V LED stripe.

## Description
The heart of the project is a STM32F4DISCOVERY board managing the whole system.
It contains bluetooth module for wireless comunication, analog ambient light sensor and motion detector.
Application software is written in **C** using *HAL* library.

SmartLight supported wireless operations:
 - Switching light on and off,
 - Switching light on and off due to motion detection,
 - Adjusting light intensity based on the intensity of ambient light,
 - Manually modifying light intensity (20% intervals).

## Tools

Hardware:
 - STM32F4DISCOVERY (STM32F407VG),
 - HC-06 FC-114 Bluetooth module,
 - PIR HC-SR501 Motion detector,
 - DFRobot Gravity PT550 Analog ambient light sensor,
 - Self made relay module using N-MOSFET transistor.
 
Software:
 - STM32CubeMX,
 - System Workbench for STM32,
 - STMStudio,
 - Serial Bluetooth Terminal application for Android.

## How to run

 - Open project in System Workbench for STM32,
 - Connect external devices to the STM32,
 - Build and run.
